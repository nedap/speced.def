# nedap.utils.spec [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nedap/utils.spec.svg?style=svg&circle-token=5895f9f338cb751d2c2e8a24844d82e21228190e)](https://circleci.com/gh/nedap/utils.spec)

Utilities for [clojure.spec](https://github.com/clojure/spec.alpha).

## Installation

#### Coordinates

```clojure
[com.nedap.staffing-solutions/utils.spec "0.8.2"]
```

> Note that self-hosted ClojureScript (e.g. Lumo) is unsupported at the moment.

#### Production setup

* In JVM Clojure, set [`*assert*`](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/9981ae9086a352caf13a42bff4a7e43faa850452/sample.project.clj#L286) to `false`.

* In ClojureScript, set [`:elide-asserts`](https://clojurescript.org/reference/compiler-options#elide-asserts) to `true`.

#### `clojure-future-spec` incompatibility

If your project happens to depend (directly or transitively; try e.g. `lein deps :tree`) on [clojure-future-spec](https://github.com/tonsky/clojure-future-spec), this library will fail to load.

You can fix that by adding e.g. `:exclusions [clojure-future-spec]` to whatever dependency was bringing it in.

You also will need to create an empty `clojure.future` ns.

## Synopsis

Despite the name, this is not a library with disparate spec-related functions (maybe, accordingly, it will be renamed to `speced.def`).

Rather, it is focused in 'speced' forms of `defn`, `defprotocol`, `fn`, etc. using the **same exact syntax** than clojure.core's.

That is achieved via metadata:

```clojure

(spec/def ::int int?)

;; You can pass functions, keywords, or primitive type hints indifferently, as metadata:
(speced/defn ^string? inc-and-serialize [^::int n, ^boolean b]
  (-> n inc str))
```

...the snippet above compiles to something akin to:

```clojure
;; note that both preconditions and type hints are emitted, derived from the specs
(defn inc-and-serialize ^String [n, ^Boolean b]
  {:pre [(int? n) (boolean? b)]
   :post [(string? %)]}
  (-> n inc str))
```

> [Expound](https://github.com/bhb/expound) is used for error reporting, so the actual emitted code is a bit more substantial.

You can pass specs as part of any nested destructurings.  

```clojure
(speced/defn destructuring-example [{:keys [^string? a] :as ^::thing all}]
  ;; :pre conditions will be emitted for `a` and `all`
  )
```

**utils.spec**'s philosophy is to bypass [instrumentation](https://clojure.org/guides/spec#_instrumentation_and_testing) altogether. Clojure's precondition system is simple and reliable, and can be cleanly [toggled](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/18a316e1c116295555a77ce77a0d8f5971bc16f7/sample.project.clj#L286) for dev/prod environments via the `clojure.core/*assert*` variable.

> In a future, we might provide a way to build your own `defn`, tweaking subjective aspects like instrumentation, while preserving all other features at no cost.

## Highlights

* 1:1 syntax mapping to clojure.core's
  * No IDE pains, nothing new to learn, trivial upgradeability from old `defn`s
  * Things like N-arities are supported.
* Multiple metadata-based 'syntaxes'
  * [Descriptions/examples](https://github.com/nedap/utils.spec/blob/master/src/nedap/utils/spec/specs.clj)
  * All of them clean: no ns pollution, no overly-concise names
* Type hints become specs
  *  e.g.`^Boolean x` is analog to `^boolean? x`
    * emits safe _and_ efficient code, addressing an old complaint about Clojure's type hinting mechanism ("it doesn't enforce types").
    * You can `^::speced/nilable ^Boolean x` if something can be nil.
* Inline function specs can become type hints
  * e.g. `^string?` will emit a `^String` type hint
  * same for ClojureScript: `^string?` -> `^string`
  * This particularly matters in JVM Clojure. [Refer to the full mapping](https://github.com/nedap/utils.spec/blob/8dac678f498fc3a77ab7cc13e5a1b3d965221735/src/nedap/utils/spec/impl/parsing.cljc#L42).
* `speced/defprotocol`, `speced/fn` are also offered
  * Same syntax and advantages as `speced/defn`
* Richer Expound integration
  * [This idea](https://github.com/bhb/expound/issues/148) is implemented here inline, as long as the Expound issue remains open.
* Full ClojureScript support
  * Did you know Clojure and ClojureScript expect type hinting metadata [at different positions](https://git.io/fjuk7)?
    * **utils.spec** abstracts over that, allowing you to write them wherever you please. 

## Status and roadmap

* Battle-tested across a variety of projects by now
  * Rough edges polished at this point, each bugfix being thoroughly unit-tested.
  * ClojureScript support is full (and fully unit-tested), but less battle-tested.
* Richer features will be added 
  * Refer to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nedap/utils.spec/issues) for getting an idea of the project's wishlist.

## ns organisation

There are exactly 4 namespaces meant for public consumption:

* `nedap.utils.speced`: 'speced' forms of defprotocol, defn, fn, etc.
* `nedap.utils.spec.api`: various utility functions, most notably `check!`.
* `nedap.utils.spec.predicates`: selected, generic predicates that you might find handy when specing things.
* `nedap.utils.spec.doc`: a public docstring registry for specs. Can be queried from arbitrary tools, and particularly [REBL](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/REBL-distro).

They are deliberately thin so you can browse them comfortably.

## Documentation

Please browse the public namespaces, which are documented, speced and tested.

It is part of this library's philosophy to avoid creating external documentation. We believe specs, particularly with our `def-with-doc` helper, can suffice, preventing duplication/drift and non-speced/non-self-documenting code.

That assumes that adopters are willing to jump to the source (particularly to the public parts, and occasionally to the tests which serve as a large corpus of examples), and preferrably have handy tooling that is able to do such jumping.
